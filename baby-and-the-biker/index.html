The door swings open to reveal two old beggars who peer expectantly into the room and smile with less teeth than a premie. One has what looks to be a half smashed ukulele with some strings missing, and the other holds a frying pan with a stick in his blackened hands. Both begin to sing, strum and clang the tune to “Merry Christmas” unceremoniously and without synchrony.</p> <p>The host rises from his seat at the table with a look of detached frustration on his face, and crosses the slum floor toward the door. He hands the old men 5 pesos and ushers them down the street toward their next mark. They depart, bowing, scraping, and hail marrying on their way.</p> <p>I sit at a table surrounded by a bunch of shady characters dressed like bikers who were introduced to me as the extended family and aquantances of the host whom I had met at a bar earlyer that night. The vibe at the table is tense and uncomfortable, but I get the impression that that’s the norm around here. </p> <p>On my left is a bedroom, and peering inside all I see is a fouton on the floor with a number of children sprawled this way and that on top of it. In the bedroom doorway stands a baby no more than 2 years old who has just witnessed the transaction with the beggars, and now demands with outstretches arms; “pera! (= money in Tagalog)”</p> <p>I smirk when it occurs to me that it might be his first word, but a more disturbing vision connecting the baby with the fate the old men brings me out of my thoughts and back into real-time.</p> <p>The men siting around me ritualistically emptying tailor made cigarettes and packing them full of weed. One of them is grumbling about “shabu”. It seems he isn’t happy about the prospect of only smoking weed tonight. It’s Christmas, after all.</p> <p>“How the hell did I end up here?” I ask myself, already knowing full well the reason. This is what happens when you deviate from the cobbled path in many parts of the world, even a little.</p> <p>The baby is screaming even louder now, with the same kind of contorted desperation you’d expect from an innocent facing execution. The noise, and to a greater degree the reason for the noise, is grating on my nerves, but everyone else just seems to ignore it. I try to say something funny to the kid, “You’ve got plenty of time to worry about money, kid. Just enjoy your life!”. Yeah right, like the kid really gives a shit about your lame attempt at humour … he’s got money on his mind, and his mind on his money!</p> <p>One of the bikers who had given me a lift on his bike earlier looks up from the table and asks me without expression to give him 50 pesos for 1L of fuel to cover the ride. “Classy guy”, I think to myself. I’ve been buying the prick food and beers all night, and now he wants to shake me down for the rent. Looking into his eyes I search for the glimmer of a soul. Nothing, he is cold as ice.</p> <p>I make a conscious decision not to make a big deal out of it (I’m not really a fan of the blades guys like him carry), but as is the case the desire for a laugh often gets the better of me. I do something stupid. I reach into my pocket and throw 5 pesos on the table in front of the man. He looks at me blankly, and I launch into my best rendition of the old beggars song complete with vocals and air guitar. The song a hit nerve with the other guys at the table, and they erupt with stoner laughter. I’m not sure if they understood the significance of my gesture, or if they were just laughing at my rediculous performance, but either way it was better than silence!</p> <p>The biker’s face turns dark and sullen. The first emotion that I’d noticed on him flickers into view; repressed rage. He’s not handling the ridicule very well. His mates are biting even harder now, and they start throwing objects at eachother from across the table. Sensing the distraction, and an imminent climax to the festivities on this most holy of nights, I take my queue and make a quick deparure through the front door without uttering a word.</p> <p>I walk away briskly, using the labyrinthine slum to obscure the line of sight from the doorway while simultaneously looking back over my shoulder and avoiding puddles of pig shit. As I walk I realise that everyone in the room was laughing except for the baby and the biker.</p> <p>Money.</p> <p>Hahahahahahahaa! Suckers…</p> </body></html> </div> </div> <div class="large-4 columns"> <div class=sidebar> <div class="sidebar-section toc"> <h4 class=no_toc id=contents>Contents</h4> </div> <div class="sidebar-section tags"> <h4>Tags</h4> <ul><li><a href="/tags/fiction/">Fiction</a></li></ul> </div> <div class="sidebar-section ad ad-300x250 sidebar-float"> <ins class=adsbygoogle style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:600px" data-ad-client=ca-pub-1397369873900370 data-ad-slot=2197667680></ins> <script>
