The Federal Reserve has been made a legalized counterfeiting operation and the member banks along with The Treasury and the Wall Street banksters have been made a legalized money laundering operation who support the federal crime syndicate while financing the campaigns of "our" elected office holders. The entire legalized illicit enterprise is founded on a terminal case of stupidity.

Insolvency actually is inherent in the system itself, a
system called fractional reserve banking. The Federal Reserve System has
legalized and institutionalized the dishonesty of issuing more hat checks than
there are hats and it has devised complex methods of disguising this practice
as a perfectly proper and normal feature of banking. Students of finance are
told that there simply is no other way for the system to function. Once that
premise is accepted, then all attention can be focused, not on the inherent
fraud, but on ways and means to live with it and make it as painless as
possible. When a bank's bookkeeping assets finally become less than its
liabilities, the rules of the game call for transferring the losses to the
depositors themselves. This means they pay twice: once as taxpayers and again
as depositors. The mechanism by which this is accomplished is called the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Using the fed to pass these losses on to the depositors through
inflation

What has any of this to do with the Federal Reserve System? The answer is
that the Federal Reserve is the starting point of the pessimistic scenario. The chain of events begins with fiat money created by a central bank, which leads to government debt, which causes inflation, which destroys the economy, which impoverishes the people, which provides an excuse for increasing government power, which is an on-going process culminating in totalitarianism. Eliminate the Federal Reserve from this equation, and the pessimis­tic scenario ceases to exist. That is the seventh and final reason to abolish the Fed: It is an instrument of totalitarianism.

If the optimistic scenario is too optimistic and the pessimistic scenario is too pessimistic, then what is the scenario that we should hope lies in our future?

There is a middle course that lies between optimism and pessimism. It is
called realism. Calling it a realistic scenario is not meant to imply that it is
predetermined to happen, nor that it is even likely to happen. It is realistic
only in the sense that it can happen if certain conditions are met.

Let us begin by allowing our opponent, Cynicism, to state the problem we face: "Is it realistic to believe that the current trends can actually be reversed? Isn't it just fantasy to think that anything can be done at this late date to break
the CFR's hold over government, media, and education? Do we really expect the gum-chewing public to go upstream against the indoctrination of newspapers,
magazines, television, and movies?"

Apathy joins in: "Forget it. There's nothing you can do. The bankers and politicians have all the money and all the power. The game is already over. Make the most
of it, and enjoy life while you can."

Do not listen to Cynicism and Apathy.

They are agents of your enemy. They want you to quietly get in line and submit
without a struggle. However, they do make a point that must not be overlooked. The battle has progressed far, and our position is not good. If we are to reverse the present trends, we must be prepared to make a herculean effort. That does
not mean "Write your Congressman" or "Vote on Tuesday" or "Sign a
petition" or "Send in a donation." That is far too easy. Those measures still play an
important role in the battle plan but they fall far short of the need. Armchair campaigns will no longer do it.

Before turning to the question of what kind of effort will be required, let us
first become clear on what it is we want to accomplish.
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When speaking about the modern capitalist economic model, the phrase “broken by design” comes to mind. Decline is inherent in it’s very design; debt is inevitably incurred or created, more money is injected into the economy, and inflation creeps in to devalue people’s hard earned wealth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fiasco continues until such time as the system becomes insolvent and comes crashing down, then it’s rinse and repeat. The idea that money is actually worth something is purely illusory, and while there was once a &lt;a href=""&gt;gold standard&lt;/a&gt;, now money is just symbolic of the banks blatant corruption, and the ineptitude of civil libertarians to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“But why on earth would anyone design it that way?”, asks the innocent child.&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s about balance of power and maintaining control, my precioussss”, replies the small clammy reptilian looking figure.&lt;br /&gt;
The small clammy figure pulls a balloon from his pocket and proceeds to inflate it, and the child sits mesmerised as the big shiny balloon inflates before his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
The small clammy figure continues to inflate the balloon, when will of a sudden, BANG!! The balloon explodes from too much air. The child bursts into tears with outstretched arms, and the small clammy figure smiles a twisted smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about &lt;a href="#fractional-reserve-banking"&gt;Fractional Reserve Banking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="#business-cycles"&gt;Business Cycles&lt;/a&gt; to find out how this process is manipulated by the banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="fractional-reserve-banking"&gt;Fractional Reserve Banking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, fractional-reserve banking means banks can legally issue more hat checks than there are hats. As defined by Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank holds reserves (to satisfy demands for withdrawals) that are less than the amount of its customers’ deposits. Reserves are held at the bank as currency, or as deposits in the bank’s accounts at the central bank. Because bank deposits are usually considered money in their own right, fractional-reserve banking permits the money supply to grow beyond the amount of the underlying reserves of base money originally created by the central bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens when everyone comes to collect and their aren’t enough hats? Therein lies the problem. Let’s illustrate the issue with a practical situation: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr Bean enters the bank to secure a $50000 home loan, with his house as collateral of course. The bank accepts the load, and gives Mr Bean his money with an interest of $5000. Mr Bean is over the moon and goes on his merry way, but what Mr Bean doesn’t know is that the money he has just been given does not actually equate to deposits held by the bank, or at the central bank (in the time of the gold standard it would have been exchangeable for gold and silver)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately for Mr Bean he has a bad gambling problem, and he blows most of his money on the horses … and the rest on a costly divorce settlement. Unable to make his repayments, poor old Mr Bean declares bankruptcy, and the bank takes his house. Mr Bean is really up shit creek, but the bank is laughing because they’ve just scored another house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr Bean’s bookie on the other hand is living it up on a yaght spending cash hand over fist, which is great for the economy because for intents and purposes it looks like “boom times”, especially at the strip club he frequents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is though, that a whole bunch of debt has been created at the central bank, and will now be generously passed on to the populace as inflation. Now Mr Bean can’t even afford a cardboard box to sleep under, and little Mr Bean Jr. (whom his missus had with her new husband) who just graduated from business school is flipping burgers at Mc Donalds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even is Mr Bean had gotten his shit together and paid back the loan, the Bank would be richer, so for the middle-man ie. the commercial bank, it’s a win-win situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations if you made it all the way through that! Hopefully it can be seen then that a fractional reserve system is inherently unstable and fraudulent, and at odds with underlying real physical variables. The money issued as loans on principle is truly created from nothing and backed up by nothing, and this is indeed the very definition of counterfeited money: &lt;em&gt;Money created from nothing and backed up by nothing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a system is designed operate in temporary cycles of artificial activity, until such a time as there is an inevitable day of reckoning wherein the system collapses onto itself, wiping away all fraudulent claims and re-synchronising wealth with its true owners. Money is destroyed, and the true order of affairs is re-established once more. See &lt;a href="#business-cycles"&gt;Business Cycles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="business-cycles"&gt;Business Cycles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business cycle, as defined in the modern day, is a primarily central bank-driven phenomenon. The Wikipedia definition does not really do it justice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The business cycle is the downward and upward movement of levels of gross domestic product (GDP) and refers to the period of expansions and contractions in the level of economic activities (business fluctuations) around its long-term growth trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central bank prints more money, injecting more credit than is necessary into the economy. The volume of money fools investors into thinking that a rapid expansion is underway, which, in turn stimulates a “boom”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the economy overheats, products and services that are an unnecessary outcome of the artificial boom become commonplace, leading to glut and, inevitably, to a collapse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the boom, the central bank may artificially increase interest rates while also raising the amount of money available via credit and its printing plants. This inflation eases the economy (best case) into a “soft landing” – after which the cycle begins again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="fixing-the-numbers"&gt;Fixing the Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!--
All capitalist economies at some point experience the inevitable decay of economic decline, its inherent in their design. 

The slippery descent of economic decline usually begins as a result of widespread corruption or mismanagement of funds within the government and banking systems, sometimes even with deliberate intent. The unfortunate fallout is felt most keenly by members of the proletariat who live from week to week on a paycheck, and rely on the wellbeing of the economy for employment and to keep interest rates and inflation minimal. [1] 

It's the task of economists working for these very same government agencies to make the economy look strong on paper, as it aids their government's agenda by bolstering public opinion and reflecting positively on the success of their policies and reforms.

While the world governments desperately play the forex in a bid to keep the outlook looking peachy from the outside in, 

It's the task of government economists to make the economy look strong on paper, as it aids their government's agenda by bolstering public opinion and reflecting positively on the success of their policies and reforms. 

In light of the statistical slights-of-hand employed by the government to doctor figures, it's necessary to seek alternative sources of information and statistics to properly gauge the actual state of the economy, such as:
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With world governments desperately playing the &lt;a href=""&gt;forex&lt;/a&gt;, and government economists employing statistical slight-of-hand to keep the economic outlook looking peachy from the outside in, &lt;!-- and bolster public opinion and reflecting positively on the success of their policies and reforms, --&gt;figures on a sheet of paper can’t always be taken at face value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s necessary to seek multiple sources of information to properly gauge the actual state of an economy, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rate of inflation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Average disposable income compared to cost of living&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interest rates and fluctuation over time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;State of health care and social welfare&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Percentage of university graduates unable to secure work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rate of unemployment among the proletariat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spend some time living among the proletariat!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-new-generation"&gt;The New Generation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dangerous times lie ahead, and the issue is social. A large portion of the youth of today (millennials) are growing up in a state of total disillusionment and disempowerment. While this may be nothing new, the odds and stakes are higher than they ever were before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, children of the previous generation grew up with strong morals values instilled by their family and the society around them. Small business owners took pride in their work, people exchanged and bartered at markets, cared for each other, and life was good. These days we have mass corporitisation and poverty breeding contempt and hate for the world in young minds, and thanks to modern technology and communications the perception of this reality is no longer isolated to the individual or the immediate community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s small wonder young people turn away from the world and immerse themselves in technology, passive entertainments and destructive behaviour. After all, what is there to look forward too? A crappy minimum wage job and a crippling mortgage in 10 years time? Please, young people need something to believe in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apathy worst enemy here - people who don’t care about anything are easily controlled and coerced. One can only hope the youngsters of the new generation wake up before all their freedoms have been systematically revoked and they are too blind to see or do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stages-of-decline"&gt;Stages of Decline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of economic decay is roughly as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In a strong economy everyone lives in abundance, goods are readily available, and life is good. People become accustomed to the good life, and complacency and a sense of entitlement sets in. Inflation and decline can caused by a number of practical reasons, including and not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fractional reserve banking loan debt (American fiasco)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Central bank generating surplus credit (Business Cycle)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Rising oil prices (peak oil scare and corruption)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Rising real-estate prices&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Government contract corruption (Philippines, china ghost cities)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Abuse of social welfare programs (Australia)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Increased supply over demand&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unions demanding wage increases&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Market bubbles&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The economy is sent into a steady decline as inflation rises. Unemployment is on the rise. Ever increasing numbers of people receive government assistance in one form or another. Government spending has increased dramatically. The price of gold, silver, and other precious metals reach record highs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prolonged periods of decay trigger a recession, causing businesses to fail and leaving a large portion of the population jobless and homeless. Infrastructure begins to decay due to reprioritisation and lack of government funds. It’s do or die for the working class, and large scale civil unrest and riots become the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;At this point the economic collapse can be sent into overdrive, when the people fearing banks will become insolvent, panic and withdraw their deposits en masse causing a “bank run”. As a bank run progresses, it generates its own kind of momentum, with the likelihood of default increasing as more people withdraw their deposits. This can destabilize a bank to the point of facing sudden bankruptcy. At this point a bank must either default (great depression, 10c on the dollar), or be bailed out (American bank bailout).
&lt;!--
 The common practice is for the government to "borrow" money to compensate for the financial crisis, incurring further debt and political inter-dependency (see the political assassin doco for more info).
--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the event of a total collapse, infrastructure grinds to a complete halt and there are no more deliveries to fill the supermarket shelves. There is a rush for supplies and everything goes within in a matter of hours. The power grid becomes unstable and rolling blackouts are a daily occurrence. Those who have hoarded goods or gasoline now offer them at exorbitant prices, and those who can’t afford them turn to vandalism and violence in order to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Total lawlessness ensues and urban areas become war zones controlled by gangs. Severe poverty and starvation become a common sight. The government implements martial law and now controls the supply and distribution of food and water. Clashes break out between civilian militia and government forces. Those who have no means of providing for themselves have no choice but to accept the government’s totalitarian regime. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id="total-collapse"&gt;Total Collapse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term “economic collapse” has been used to describe a broad range of bad economic conditions, ranging from a severe, prolonged depression with high bankruptcy rates and high unemployment (such as the Great Depression of the 1930s), to a breakdown in normal commerce caused by hyperinflation (such as in Weimar Germany in the 1920s), or even an economically caused sharp increase in the death rate and perhaps even a decline in population (such as in countries of the former USSR in the 1990s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A total collapse can be triggered may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock or the bursting of an economic bubble, and may be also brought about suddenly by way of a natural disaster or epidemic. A collapse is often accompanied by social chaos, civil unrest and sometimes a breakdown of law and order resulting an total anarchy. (examples)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our fragile society is comprised of so many complex moving parts, which at any point could come crumbling down around our ears. Very few people are ready for such an occurrence, and it’s both frightening and necessary to understand that at any given moment we are only three square meals away from total anarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--

## What Does It Look Like?

A pessimistic scenario of future events includes a banking crisis, followed by a
government bailout and the eventual nationali­zation of all banks. The
final cost is staggering and is paid with money created by the Federal Reserve.
It is passed on to the public in the form of inflation.

Further inflation is caused by the continual expansion of welfare programs, socialized
medicine, entitlement programs, and interest on the national debt. The dollar is finally
abandoned as the de facto currency of the world. Trillions of dollars are
sent back to the United States by foreign investors to be converted as
quickly as possible into tangible assets. That causes even greater
inflation than before. So massive is the inflationary pressure that
industry and commerce come to a halt. Barter becomes the means of
exchange. America takes her place among the depressed nations of
South America, Africa, and Asia—mired together in economic equality.

domestic violence, 

, a new global currency, the arrival of U.N. "Peacekeeping" forces, and a new totalitarian regime enforcing high-tech feudalism.


We have already seen recent
--&gt;
&lt;!--
But this time, the programs begin to take on an international flavor. The American dollar is replaced by a new UN money, and the Federal Reserve System becomes a branch operation of the IMF/World Bank.
--&gt;

&lt;!--
A pessimistic scenario of future events includes a banking crisis (such as what's currently unfolding in both America and Europe) leading to hyperinflation and a collapse of the economy.

Politicians seize upon the opportunity and offer bold reforms. The reforms are more of exactly what caused the problem in the first place: expanded governmental power, new regulatory agencies, and more restrictions on freedom. 

The failed currency will be replaced a new one designed so that electronic transfers will gradually replace cash and checking accounts. This permits government agencies to monitor the financial activities of every person. A machine-readable ID card is used for that purpose. If an individual is red flagged by any government agency, the card does not clear, and he is cut off from all economic transactions and travel. It is the ultimate control.

Increasing violence in the streets from revolutionary movements and ethnic clashes provide the government with an excuse for martial law. The public is happy to see "Peacekeepers" checking ID cards. The police-state arrives in the name of public safety.

Eventually all private dwellings are taken over by the government as a result of bailing out the home-mortgage industry. Rental property is also taken, as former landlords are unable to pay property taxes. People are allowed to live in these dwellings at reasonable cost, or no cost at all. It gradually becomes clear, however, that the government is now the owner of all homes and apartments. People are living in them only at the pleasure of the government. They can be reassigned at any time.

Wages and prices are controlled. Dissidents are placed into work armies. There are no more autos except for the ruling elite. Public transportation is provided for the masses, and those with limited skills live in government housing within walking distance of their assigned jobs. Men have been reduced to the level of serfs who are subservient to their masters. Their condition of life can only be described as high-tech feudalism.
--&gt;

&lt;!--
There is no certainty that the future will unfold in exactly that manner, because there are too many variables. For example, if we had assumed that there will not be a banking crisis, then our journey would be different. We would not see long lines of depositors or panic-buying in the stores or closing of the stock market. But we would still witness the same scenes of despair in the more distant future. We merely would have traveled a different path of events to get there. That is because the forces driving our society into global totalitarianism would not have changed one iota. We still would have the doomsday mechanisms at work. We would have the CFR in control of the power centers of government and the media. We would have an electorate which is unaware of what is being done to them and, therefore, unable to resist. Through environmental and economic treaties and through military disarmament to the UN, we would witness the same emergence of a world central bank, a world government, and a world army to, enforce its dictates. Inflation and wage/price controls would have progressed more or less the same, driving consumer goods out of existence and mmen into bondage. Instead of moving toward The New World Order in a series of economic spasms, we merely would have traveled a less violent path and arrived at exactly the same destination.
--&gt;

&lt;!--
* **Travel Restrictions** This will begin with restrictions on foreign travel, including suspension/removal of passports. (This has begun in a small way in both the EU and US.) Later, travel restrictions will be extended within the boundaries of countries (highway checkpoints, etc.)

* **Confiscation of wealth** The EU has instituted the confiscation of bank accounts, which can be expected to become an international form of governmental theft. This does not automatically mean that other assets, such as precious metals and real estate will also be confiscated, but it does mean that the barrier for confiscation has been eliminated. There is therefore no reason to assume that any asset is safe from any government that approves theft through bail-ins.

* **Food Shortages** The food industry operates on very small profit margins and survives only as a result of quick payment of invoices. With dramatic inflation, marginal businesses (suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers) will fall by the wayside. The percentage of failing businesses will be dependent upon the duration and severity of the inflationary trend.

* **Squatters Rebellions** A dramatic increase in the number of home and business foreclosures will result in homelessness for anyone whose debt exceeds his ability to pay—even those who presently appear to be well-off. As numbers rise significantly, a new homeless class will be created amongst the former middle class. As they become more numerous, large scale ownership of property may give way to large scale “possession” of property.

* **Riots** These will likely happen spontaneously due to the above conditions, but if not, governments will create them to justify their desire for greater control of the masses.

* **Martial Law** Martial Law and may be initially termed as EPP (Emergency Police Protection). The US has already prepared for this, with the passing of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which many interpret as declaring the US to be a “battlefield.” The NDAA allows the suspension of habeas corpus, indefinite detention, and the assumption that any resident may be considered an enemy combatant. Similar legislation may be expected in other countries that perceive martial law as a solution to civil unrest.


## Preparedness
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills that are deemed to be important in our modern world will cease to be relevant, and a much more practical set of survival skills and preparedness will be required. It is therefore prudent to be prepared and educate yourself in the event that such disasters may come to pass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come soon …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind is a tricky mistress, but it’s our mistress, and with the proper focused training it can be taught to function and create beyond our wildest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in most fields that push the boundaries of fringe science, our knowledge neuroscience is limited; we don’t know how the really brain functions and stores information yet, but we do know how to program it for a higher level of efficiency. Wouldn’t it be a shame if the crazy super-computer that sits in your head wasn’t able to shine because you didn’t learn the proper commands?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind and body that understands the underlying principles of nature can apply them to great effect in learning, thinking and application. The education system hasn’t done much for us in this regard, tending to cram our minds full of facts and figures, rather than teaching it about system, technique and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a psychologist or a neuroscientist, just a humble programmer and martial artist, and as such my information will not be presented in the standard academic format. However, I’ve worked hard to sharpen my skills over the years, and am now having a great time working with some of the top companies in the world - so glean from this article what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

The mind processes information visually in the language of forms and shapes[], but the perception and meaning of this language is governed by conscious and unconscious patterns. Physicists, alchemists, philosophers and mathematicians, and more, all attempt to explain nature by reducing it into more understandable and manageable data sets. The good news is you don't need a fancy degree, just strong will and a perceptive mind.

&lt;h3 id="paradoxical-thinking"&gt;Paradoxical Thinking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxical thinking is an important element of learning that challenges us to look beyond the bounds of what is considered rational and therefore ‘valid’. Paradoxically, paradoxical arguments are generally considered to be ‘invalid’, but the value of the paradox lies not it it’s validity, it’s in the resulting journey of the mind that’s given rise to by &lt;!--the reconciliation of--&gt; conflicting arguments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
- yin yang and paradoxes
	- for most ideas that are considered to be true, there are generally polar opposites that are also considered to be true. This forms the basis 'Yin Yang', the Chinese belief that states that everything in nature has an opposite, otherwise it could not exist in the first place.

Masters of their destiny will tell you that the human animal thrives under genuine adversity, with the constant guidance of the internal voice of opposition.
If the minds ability to question 
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darwinism teaches us that an organism requires adversity in order to thrive or evolve into a stronger version of itself. Take a look at our own history - nothing great has ever been achieved without a significant measure of conflict and adversity. Therefore, think of the paradox is the equivalent of fighting a war in the mind. Without regular battle we all know the troops become restless and complacent, and the last thing you want is for your troops to turn to the booze and brothels - unless you so will it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While paradoxical thinking plays an important role in helping you to ask the right questions, it’s also a trap in it’s own right. The problem with “thinking”, is that the mind ends up getting caught up in an endless iteration, with no hope of a resolution until the scope changes and more data becomes available and or accessible. Since most of our actual processing happens at a subconscious level, we don’t have as much control over the process as we would like. This is why you just can’t remember the name of that gorgeous actress when you want to, and the name always pops into your head a minute later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many computers programs, the brain uses multiple threads and to defer long running intensive tasks. This means that once you’ve fed your brain the correct information, it’s time to take a step back and let it do what it does best. There’s no point in rushing - you’d be better off sticking 10,000v wires in your ear and hoping that it made you smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid lazyness too. It’s hard with all this awesome technology I know, but the mind that becomes complacent forgets how to visit the extremes, and the internal voice that desires knowledge and action becomes nothing more than the whisper of self-loathing that drives self-destructive tendencies, and is eventually lost altogether. 
&lt;!-- 
	Trying to shortcut the process is as futile
	as trying to break the natural laws, but we can use stronger laws to overcome weaker laws to optimise the result. 
 which is the ability to see directly to the heart of things
--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paradoxical thinking is only a way of thinking, and a step on the path to true intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="true-intelligence"&gt;True Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True intelligence is the ability to see directly to the heart of things, either by way of empirical knowledge, or some unexplained primordial intuition&lt;!--[]--&gt;. Questions are often raised as to weather our knowledge is self-contained, or if we are connected to some other combined or cloud consciousness, but theyre purely speculative. For the purpose of thios article we’ll just assume that knowledge is learned, and that anything else is outside of our direct control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many forms of intelligence, academic, intuitive, emotional and so on, but it’s the combination of all these forms of intelligence that affords us the “insight” and “wisdom” to tackle the really big problems. Our current society and education system is geared up so that only the academic subset is of any real value, and everything else is largely superfluous. Hopefully you don’t believe that to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein’s genius was attributed to his ability to perceive the heart of things with a childlike sincerity. While everyone else was explaining themselves in circles with complex equations, Einstein’s discoveries were so black and white that everyone hit themselves on the head asking “why the hell didn’t I think of that?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of true inteligence is objective perception. Imagine you’re a baby taking your first steps; how vivid and present the experience must be. For children there’s no layers between what’s happening and what’s experienced. For most of us though, our psyche is so marred with unconscious patterning and coping mechanisms, that by the time we reach adulthood the ability to be truly present in the moment is a distant memory. The irony here is that when the mind reaches this stage, becoming more intelligent is actually more of an unlearning or an unravelling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True intelligence is dependent on more that just our perception though; equally important is the ability to process information and act accordingly in the moment. While these skills come more naturally for some, they are available to all by following a path of mastery that incorporates the mind, body and spirit, and constant testing of limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
So what does it mean to see to the "heat of things"? 

 far from it, it's to say that  
, which is necessary for perception
where the adult mind tends to analyse and rationalise itself around in circles. In this respect, our mind is it's own worst enemy.

Over time something changes; the mind develops comping mechanisms and patterns that filter stimulus and affect the way we process information. we become desensitised and dull.

A quality that's recognises in children (and also Einstein), is their ability to perceive the heart of the situation.

Most of the information in the brain is stored in the subconscious, whch is always processing, this can't happen until the conscious mind takes a break. 

, and that's something that can't happen when the mind is on endless iteration. 

Every day we are bombarded with an insane amount of stimulus, and if we were consciously aware of it all at once, the we would surely go insane! The mind conveniently develops coping mechanisms that filter and sometimes modify non-critical and overly traumatic details and experiences. While these mechanisms are necessary, the process of desensitisation can dull the mind over time.

An intelligent and active mind is defined by it's ability to see directly to the core of the matter; either by way of empirical knowledge, or some unexplained primordial intuition[]. For now we'll assume that knowledge is learned, and that anything else is outside of our direct control, therefore outside the scope of this article.


So how does one stay sane in a world full of contradictions and paradoxes?

The first thing required is will-power, the will to constantly override the internal voice of opposition which wants to enforce your learned patterns.
Will-power is developed though conflict, be it with the self, others or situational. 
The key to developing will-power, as well as most learned skills, is focus.
--&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wu-gong-masters"&gt;Wu-Gong Masters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gong fu masters are the true masters of reality, for they have connected the mind to the the body in a way that enables them to achieve seemingly super-human feats. These feats may seem improbable and even impossible to most, and I would tend to agree had I not had the privelidge of training with some of the top masters myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In martial arts there are two predominant philosophies; one that favours the hard (external), and one that favours the soft (internal). Internal martial arts that focus on how to maximise force with minimal effort are of particular interest to me, because they show the existence of a commonly misunderstood force that can’t be generated by muscular exertion alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a “special” force that moves through the human body that can be accessed and demonstrated by a few of the top masters at will. I’m not going to call it “ki”, “qi” or anything else liable to be misinterpreted or accompanied with hallucinations of mystical warriors flying through bamboo forests, rather it’s the kind of condition that allows a mother to lift up a car to rescue her baby&lt;!--[]--&gt;, or a master to project their entire body mass through a small movement.&lt;/p&gt;

Sigong Chu has the ability to read your energy and intent before you even know what's happening yourself. I don't know about you, but for me that's way cooler than reciting PI to 100,000 places.

Those who spend a lot of time in their mind often neglect their body, but it's only through the combination of mind, body and what we subjectively call spirit, that true intelligence can be attained.These skills though,but they have a much greater potential over short term physical gains.

This is why they take so long, and require a certain type of individual to master them.
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chu Shong Tin is one such master who can demonstrate these abilities. Sigong Chu is a life-long Wing Chun practitioner known as the “King of Siu Lim Tao”, and is one of Yip Man’s oldest and most highly regarded students. Sigong Chu often talks about “Lim Tao”, which is a mind-body connection that allows him to transfer “Lim Lik” or mind force while in a state of complete muscular relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigong Chu has mastered the internal forces to the point where he can switch it on at will, and move it through his entire body. He tells a story about how he once had an MRI scan and decided to switch on his ‘Lim Lik’ to see what part of his brain was activating. The doctors told him to stop doing whatever he was doing, because it was throwing the readings out. According to Chu the cerebellum is the part of the brain that activates, which makes a lot of sense because it’s also the part of the brain that controls the synapses to the central nervous system, and a part of the brain we know very little about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be said that the study of internal martial arts requires a specific kind of abstract intelligence that relies on feeling and intuition. The internal arts deal with “concepts” and “ideas” that can be applied in the body to transfer and deal with force. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn these ideas, the student must be able to feel them in their body, and train them to the point where the neural pathways pertaining to the “idea” are so well mapped out, that they can be triggered with a single thought. The challenging thing for most is to reconcile is that these ideas don’t exist predominantly in the head, they’re directly related to a movement of energy through the body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking with the masters you often hear them talk about “state, not shape”. What this means is that if the idea is working properly, the shape of the body, or the hand technique being applied, is irrelevant. This is interesting, because it shows us that physicality plays a secondary role in generating true force, rather it’s a state of mind that can be triggered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an wonderful avenue of study, but take care if you’re perusing these skills, because there are countless frauds out there, and probably a handful of people in the world who can actually demonstrate these skills properly.&lt;/p&gt;

 in the brain and body
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In nature, as well as the human mind, we can observe geometric patterns and principles that reoccur - we call it sacred geometry. As energy collides and interacts at the mercy of the &lt;!--variables and constants that comprise the--&gt; laws of nature, it stands to reason that there will be convergent similarities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patterns of the mind, both conscious and unconscious, govern the way we perceive sensory input and stored memories. In essence, reality doesn’t change, but the way we see it does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought patterns are learned and enforced on us from from the time of our birth, by our parents, friends, work, and society as whole. Many of these patterns are so ingrained into every day life, that they are absurdly considered by everyone to be “normal”. The deeper you look into your own life and the world around you, the more the matrix of patterns that comprise perceived reality will be exposed. The practice of identifying and understanding the patterns that influence the mind is a worthy pursuit, especially when those patterns may deprive us of our full potential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more patterns we take on board throughout life, the more disconnected we become from our source, and the less “free” we become. This metamorphosis prevents us from being able to express ourselves truly, and simply “be in the the moment”. Without patterns we would exist in a state of bliss, but the truth is that some patterns are necessary for our very survival, so it’s up to your discretion as to what you want to keep, and what you let go of. The principle of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"&gt;Neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt; ensures that our mind is ever changing, and we have control over how it develops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="visualise"&gt;Visualise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step is to visualise the pattern you want to let go of. Mental patterns are constructs of consciousness, so they can be visualised as constructs in the form of shapes and emotions by the way they intersect with, and influence the energetic space in which they exist. The more you can isolate variables and constants which formulate the pattern, the clearer and more aware of the pattern will become&lt;!--, and in turn it's affect on your entire life--&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, calm your mind and relax your body - the deeper your mediative state the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system is both as simple and complex as the sum of all of its parts&lt;!--[]--&gt;, so start by visualising your life and consciousness as the overall system, and your patterns as the parts which comprise the whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re aware of your pattern and can visualise and it’s constructs, then you’re ready to make your peace and finally let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 
Mental patterns can be visualised as forms and shapes by the way they intersect and influence the energetic space in which they exist. 

-- isolate variables and constants, constructs
The first step to changing subconscious patterning is to gain insight about it through experience, meditation and interaction with others. 

Start by viewing your life as whole, then use reductive thinking? (reverse engineering?) until you arrive at the source of the patterns you're not satisfied with and want to change.

	This is not about fighting, it's about letting go. Resistance is futile. 
Consciously enter into the process of the pattern that you want to let go of, and be totally aware of
the constants and variables that construct your pattern, and
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter into a meditative state again, and become aware consciously aware of the pattern that you want to let go of, and how it affects your mind and body. Explore all the parts of your pattern, including the journeys it has taken you on over the course of your life. Wherever this takes you just go with it, and weather you feel pain, fear, rage, or loss, just experience those feelings and allow them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that resistance is futile; you can’t fight negativity with hatred or more negativity, this is about accepting and letting go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before long you will feel clear again, like a weight has been lifted - but we’re not done yet! When you’ve accepted your pattern, and dealt with the associated negative feeling and emotions, you’re ready to override your original programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
By accepting your pattern for what it is you stop fighting and become consciously aware of it, an begin to release it's unconscious hold on you.
--&gt;

&lt;h3 id="override"&gt;Override&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overriding your original programming is as simple as doing something that’s completely contradictory to your original programming. The more you do it the better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about breaking patterns and limitations, so go nuts. Those that follow the rules their entire live get a life of sub achievement, and a pat on the back with the possibility of a nice retirement fund at the end. Big whoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that everything that’s considered normal today was outrageous and preposterous at one point in time. At best people will think you’re a savant, and at worst they’ll think you’re an idiot, maybe a little of both, but who really gives a shit what people think anyway!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--Not much more needs to be said - have fun, and above all, be outrageous. This is, after all, about breaking patterns and limitations!

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When science fails to answer the unanswerable questions regarding life and the universe, man is compelled to venture deeper into the realms of the unknown and the unseen for the answers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great shamanic cultures of old, whose mastery and understanding of nature is unparalleled, all have one thing in common - the use of mind-altering psychedelics. Take for example, the Amazonian jungle tribes of South America. These jungle shamans concocted a brew called Ayahuasca, which contains an ingenious mix of DMT yielding plants, and a vine which acts as a MAO inhibiter that’s essential for DMT to become psychoactive when ingested orally. How could they have known about this? I’m guessing it wasn’t trial and error. Native Americans, all the way back to the Aztecs and Toltec Indians, used Mescaline to induce sacred visions, divine the future, and as a god-powerful medicine. Even the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung, the so called “father of Chinese medicine” used cannabis as a medicine, and burned it at ceremonies and rituals some 5000 years ago (approximately 2695 BCE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this last century our understanding of psychedelics increased dramatically, but we still haven’t really scrateched the surface. Modern society and scientific reasoning have taught us to discount and devalue anything that can’t be quantified or easily referenced, but as logic and technology take over our minds and lives, we find there’s something missing - something inside of us cries out for a deeper understanding and connection to nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to tackle the the original paradox of thought, to “think that which is unthinkable”, it’s necessary to drastically change the scope and frame of reference within which our consciousness operates. This is where psycadelics have been instrumental in enabling some of the greatest minds and discoveries in history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
	, so one can’t help but to wonder if there's a missing piece of the puzzle that can’t be explained or understood by modern science and chemistry alone. 
--&gt;

&lt;h2 id="phenythylamines-and-tryptamines"&gt;Phenythylamines and Tryptamines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most psychedelics we know about fall into two main chemical “classes” or “families”, known as phenythylamines and tryptamines. For chemistry novices, the tryptamine family contains substances like LSD, Psylocybin (contained within magic mushrooms), and DMT, while the phenythylamine family include substances like MDMA, 2C-B, MDA, amphetamines and mescaline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those wishing to expand their knowledge on phenythylamines and tryptamines, the works of &lt;a href="https://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/shulgin_alexander/"&gt;Alexander Shulgin&lt;/a&gt; provide unsurpassed insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Theodore “Sasha” Shulgin (June 17, 1925 – June 2, 2014) was an American medicinal chemist, biochemist, pharmacologist, psychopharmacologist, and author. Shulgin is best known for introducing MDMA (also known as “ecstasy”) to psychologists in the late 1970s for psychopharmaceutical use, but his real legacy is discovereing, synthesising, and personally bioassaying over 230 psychoactive compounds, and evaluating them for their psychedelic and/or entactogenic potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sasha Shulgin and his wife, Ann — a psychedelic therapist, speaker, and author in her own right — regularly tried new compounds from Sasha’s lab. If, after considerable self-experimentation, a compound proved worthy of further analysis, they would share it with a group of close friends. The “research group” would test the new chemical and rate it for duration, psychedelic qualities, and other effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shulgins published the results of their research, including the theory, sysnthesis and effects of each substance is documented in two groundbreaking volumes, PiHKAL and TiHKAL. The titles stand for Phenethylamines and Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved. As Sasha once put it, everyone has “the license to explore the nature of his own soul.”, and as testament to the couple’s goal of free public access to information the books are published online &lt;a href="http://isomerdesign.com/PiHKAL/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://isomerdesign.com/TiHKAL/_"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
Dr Shulgan was a chemist (operating from behind the iron curtain) in the 1960’s-1980’s, who personally synthesised, administered and documented the effects of each of these substances using different methods and dosages, as well as many other derivatives?. The result of her lives work is contained in two books, Phikal (phenythylamines), and Thikal (tryptamines) which are freely available online.


The Shulgins published the results of their research in two groundbreaking volumes, PiHKAL and TiHKAL. The titles stand for Phenethylamines and Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved. For chemistry novices, the tryptamines are a chemical family including LSD, DMT, and psilocybin; phenethylamines include mescaline, MDMA, 2C-B, and MDA. Both classes contain many psychedelic compounds — Shulgin’s specialty.

Modern society and scientific reasoning has taught us to discount anything that can’t be quantified or easily referenced, to the point where the practices of spirituality and mysticism are met with skepticism, and often shunned. This is hardly surprising due to our restrictive legal system, and the ridiculous amount of misinformation that’s propagated over the internet and beyond, but as we draw further from nature, there’s something inside of us cries out for a deeper connection that cannot be satisfied by logic and technology alone.

&lt;h2 id="misconceptions"&gt;Misconceptions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that “all drugs are bad”, but in reality each chemical structure in nature is unique, and serves it’s own special purpose. To classify them all as “bad” because some legal doctrine says so, is ignorance of the highest degree (please excuse my frankness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the decades the propaganda machine has shown us pictures of deformed acid babies, and homeless people with vacant lifeless eyes roaming the streets. The truth is that psychedelic substances, unlike opiates and amphetamines, aren’t actually addictive, and these horrifying images are more indicative of heroine and ice abusers. If fact, it’s interesting to note that people who have used psychedelics tend to be more intelligent and open minded. Anyone who claims otherwise has probably never tried them, or has an ulterior motive or hidden agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many great and famous people throughout history have used substances like LSD for inspiration and insight. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs"&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/a&gt; used LSD to invision his world changing range of Apple products. If “think different” isn’t a classic psychonaut’s motto, then I don’t know what is! Jobs says it best in his own words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Taking LSD was a profound experience, one of the most important things in my life. LSD shows you that there’s another side to the coin, and you can’t remember it when it wears off, but you know it. It reinforced my sense of what was important—creating great things instead of making money, putting things back into the stream of history and of human consciousness as much as I could.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobel Prize winner &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick"&gt;Francis Crick&lt;/a&gt;, and the pioneer of modern genetics is another. He regularly took small amounts of LSD to aid his thought process, and he claims it was LSD that helped him to unravel and discover the double-helix structure of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other noteworthy examples, but less known and no less incredible are the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=alex+grey"&gt;artworks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Grey"&gt;Alex Grey&lt;/a&gt;. Alex Grey also attributes his insight and undertanding of the energetics of the human form to the use of LSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like anything, psychedelics can be abused and overused. In people who overuse psychedelics we can observe a rift or disassociation with reality, in which they find it hard to focus and apply themselves. However, it’s difficult to link this directly to the use of psychedelics, since theres a high likelihood that the kind of people who would abuse psychedelics would already be afflcited with attention defecit disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should also be aknowledged that psychedelics aren’t for everyone, and can even be terrifying for those with a fragile state of mind, or a traumatic past. They need to be used and respected for what they are, not a common “party drug”, but as a powerful tool for the purpose of knowledge and insight.&lt;/p&gt;

, much to the discomfort of the user
Alex … is an incredible artist with an unparalleled understanding of the human form, who also attributes his insight to the use of LSD.

Contrary to the message spread by the propaganda machine campaigns, Psycadelics substances, unlike opiates and amphetamines, aren’t addictive. If misused, or overused, they may have adverse affects on the mental state of the user, but if taken occasionally with the right motivation and they can offer unprecedented insight into the nature of like and reality, that would not otherwise be available to the individual. The nature and intensity of the psychedelic "trip" is such that it’s not addictive  like other substances, such as amphetamines and opiates, and anyone who states otherwise has obviously never tried them or has al anterior agenda.

Throughout the decades there has been much anti-drug propaganda, but it bares little connection to reality. The kind of ignorance which proliferates that "all drugs are bad" must be avoided at all costs, each molecule in nature is unique, and serves it’s own unique purpose. 

The Buddhists used psychedelics when at the verge of enlightenment, in order to traverse the final bridge to enlightnment.

### DMT Effects
--&gt;

&lt;h2 id="lsd"&gt;LSD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lysergic Acid Diethylamine, commonly referred to as LSD, LSD-25, or Acid, is a semi-synthetic substance synthesised from ergotamine, an alkaloid present in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergot"&gt;ergot&lt;/a&gt;. Ergot is a parasitic, and highly toxic fungus known as Clabviceps Purpurea, which grows on the Rye plant. In the middle ages, ergot was responsible for a number of epidemics when ergot infected Rye was milled into bread and consumed by thousands, causing ergotism (ergot poisoning, commonly known as “Saint Anthonies Fire”) on a mass public scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LSD was inadvertently discovered by &lt;a href="http://www.hofmann.org/"&gt;Albert Hoffman&lt;/a&gt; in 1938, while working on a research project for the Swiss drug company, Sandoz. At the time, Hoffman’s research was focused on Lysergic Acid, a compound derived from ergot, for a number of medicinal applications. When Hoffman first synthesised LSD-25, he hoped that it would be able stimulate breathing and circulation. After the first round of tests were inconclusive, LSD-25 was shelved despite Hoffman feeling that the compounds potential hadn’t beed fully explored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five years later, Hoffman’s thoughts returned to LSD-25, and he took the unusual step of synthesising another batch for further testing. During the testing process, Hoffman must have got some on his finger and touched it to his mouth (LSD cannot be absorbed through the skin), because he had to stop work and leave home early due to a feeling of “being affected by a feeling of remarkable restlessness, combined with a slight dizziness”. According to Hoffman, during his bike ride home, and later that night, he “perceived an uninterrupted stream of fantastic pictures, extraordinary shapes with intense, kaleidoscopic play of colours”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoffman reported his findings to Sandoz, who ran more clinical trials, and were very excited by their initial findings; no other substance was so potent at such low quantity, and had such a low toxicity relative to the dosage. Sandoz quickly saw the potential of LSD for use in psychotherapy, and provided LSD samples to research instates and doctors for further psychiatric experimentation. By 1947, the research was compelling enough to convince Sandoz to patent LSD, and package and market it as Delysid to be sold in 25 microgram tablets for use in psychotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Sandoz threw open the doors to “anyone” who cared to purchase LSD, the Americal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) became paranoid. The CIA knew the Russians were engaged in tests to create truth serums, and undermine the behaviour and personalities of regular people to turn them into unwitting and involuntary assassins. This has the CIA spooked, the U.S. government started their own experiments by testing the effects of the drug. From 1953 to 1964, the CIA ran a program called MK-ULTRA, which was an umbrella operation covering 149 subprojects with the purpose of exploring new methods of chemical and psychological warfare. Experiments were conducted on voluntary subjects in exchange for her heroin and other drugs, and on hundreds of unsuspecting American civilians, prison inmates, federal agents, and military personal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1975 congress held inquiries into the alleged clandestine operation named MK-ULTRA, but CIA maintained it’s standard silence; the files had been destroyed and the new directors had no knowledge of old projects. Two years later, the skeleton that was MK-ULTRA in the CIA’s closet emerged entirely, thanks to a Freedom of Information act request lodged by a journalist that turned up several boxes of information that had escaped destruction. These documents exposed information on places, names, methods of electro-shock torture, poisoning by sleight of hand, how they used hookers to lure unsuspecting civilians for undisclosed testing, slipped LSD into drinks at bars, and conducted interrogations with subjects under the prolonged influence of LSD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, when LSD escaped the lab it was quickly evangelised by hippies and clandestine chemists such as Owsley Stanley. LSD was the drug of choice which played a pivotal role in the consciousness shift that enabled the 1960’s counterculture and revolution to take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting thing to note is the contrast in the way the way LSD has been perceived and used by different groups. Just as one segment of the American population started experimenting with the drug in order to produce peace and spiritual awakening, their government was using the same drug to try and “brainwash” people into compliance. Where the hippies saw unity and joy; the CIA saw paranoia and fear.&lt;/p&gt;

—————— use in the 60’s revolution
The 60’s saw LSD incorporated into an entire culture shift, away from conformatism, towards freedom and self-expression.

The younger generation until then had only experienced a life of conformatism, but now they had an alternative, and for a time it was beautiful. The revolution was about free love, and peace, spurred by the taking of mind-altering psycadellics. People lived as one heart, and one soul, yet as seems to be the curse of our existence, too much of a good thing isn;t sustainable, kind of like natures way of keeping us on track. (ugg)

To concede with the 60’s revolution, the govern began their own more sinister experimentation on this amazing new molecule

The government, however, had had a much more sinister motivation for their interest in LSD. They wanted to use it for the purpose of control, to create super soldiers through prolonged use of psychedelics, coupled with extreme conditions and suggestive thinking - in short brain washing.

These unfortunate experiments, such as MKULTRA (link to gov docs) and …?, apparently yielded no usable results (that we know of), with subjects tending to go insane and loosing grip of reality altogether.


Sandoz stopped making LSD by 1966, apparently due to the company claiming there was a lack of regulation and inaccurate information being permeated about the drug.
Naturall, this didn’t discourage chemists from manufacturing LAD, which was legal to do until 1965.


### Synthesis

organic chemistry, black light, 

——————

Probably the single greatest discovery of our modern era was that of LSD, by the late DR Hoffman (dead?). The story goes that DR Hoffman was experimenting with enrol derivatives, when he made a change discovery that would be largely responsible for the large shift in consciousness and the 60’s revolution.

Enrot was a substance that was responsible for the … plague, and the subsequent witch burnings in the 18…s. It is a small fungus that infected the Rye plant, and in turn was milled into bread poisoning a large population of the … and responsible for the … plague and the … in …    ergotism

At the time Dr hoffman was experimenting with ergot related derivatives for use in medicine when he by change synthesised the substance that would be largely responsible for the modern revolution and the mass shift in consciousness in the 60’s.

At the time Hoffman synthesised LSD, he had no idea of it’s inherent properties, but had an intuition that there was something special about the molecule (he had tries to synthesise it a few times before). After finding no apparent medical applications for the substance, he head home on the bicycle, at which time he started to feel a little strange. Before long the sky broke out in kaleidoscopic colours and hallucinations and he knew he had discovered something special. Upon returning home, He notified his colleague at the time, dr. …, and commenced full research into this amazing new substance.

## Mescaline

## DMT
--&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dmt"&gt;DMT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMT, or Dimethyltryptamine, is a member of the tryptamine family, and is arguably the most fascinating psychedelic substance known to man. DMT exists naturally within each one of us, and in trace amounts in almost every living plant and animal. It could be said that DMT is the “spirit molecule”, the link between the physical body and the realm of spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite modern advancements in neuroscience, modern science actually knows very little about DMT. The DMT molecule is structurally analogous to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) and the hormone melatonin, and furthermore functionally analogous to other psychedelic tryptamines, such as bufotenin, and psilocybin. We know that DMT is stored in the pineal gland inside the brain, and is excreted at the time of death, but the significance of its widespread natural presence or propose remains undetermined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DMT was first synthesised in 1931 by Canadian chemist Richard Helmuth Fredrick Manske, but in fact it’s been used as a psychedelic drug for divinatory and healing purposes by the Amazonian Indians for thousands of years. Obviously the jungle shamans didn’t synthesise or extract pure DMT in their laboratories, but looking at some of the facts they apparently know a lot more about it than we do today. By combining plants with high levels of DMT, and a particular vine that serves as a natural MAO inhibiter, the jungle shamans created a brew called ayahuasca. DMT is not psychoactive when consumed orally, but they somehow knew that by combining DMT yielding plants with a naturally occurring MAOI, not only could the DMT be absorbed by the digestive track, but the experience could be stretched from several minutes to several hours. It remains unclear as to how these shamans were able to devise this ingenious method of ingesting DMT, but one can only speculate that they were able to divine it through deeper a connection with the plants, and some even say they were provided instruction by the plant spirits themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One area that warrants further investigation is the similarity of the effects of DMT to those reported by NDEs (Near Death Experiences) and OBEs (Outer Body Experiences). People who have experienced temporary brain death often report travelling towards a “light at the end of the tunnel”, and having conversations with spiritual entities - all of which are indicative of the DMT experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When taking DMT one often experiences leaving the body completely, and traversing space or what could only be described as passing through many alternate dimensions at a very fast rate. After the initial experience of travelling, it’s not uncommon to meet certain spirits or entities with which one can converse. Many report these entities taking the familiar guise of people known over the course of one’s lifetime, either living or dead. The common factor with the entities encountered during these meetings is their transcendental wisdom, and while the interactions and conversations held with them van vary greatly from person to person, through them one can gain insight into a great many things, such as the clarity around past and present choices, the deeper meaning of things, and the purpose of one’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experiences can be very frightening for some, especially those that have strayed from their path and are brought face to face with the reality of their choices without mercy or remorse. However, and almost always yields positive results for the person involved, and is always illuminating. The trick is not to hold on, but to yield oneself fully to the experience, because control is just an illusion, and anything less than absolute truth cannot exist within the realm of DMT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="mescaline"&gt;Mescaline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mescaline or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine is the naturally occurring alkaloid present in the &lt;a href="https://www.erowid.org/plants/peyote/peyote.shtml"&gt;peyote&lt;/a&gt; cactus (Lophophora williamsii), the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinopsis_pachanoi"&gt;San Pedro&lt;/a&gt; cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi) and in the Peruvian torch (Echinopsis peruviana), and as well in a number of other members of the Cactaceae plant family. It’s also found in small amounts in certain members of the Fabaceae (bean) family, including Acacia berlandieri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mescaline is a member of the phenethylamine class, but it’s hallucinogenic qualities bear more similarity to members of the tryptamine class, such as LSD and psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peyote has been used for at least 5700 years by Native Americans in Mexico. Europeans noted use of peyote in Native American religious ceremonies upon early contact, notably by the Huichols in Mexico. Other mescaline-containing cacti such as the San Pedro have a long history of use in South America, from Peru to Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peyote and other divine plants, including “magic” psilocybin mushrooms, morning glory seeds, and datura, were employed for the purposes of healing, divining the future, and producing visions during sacred rites and rituals. Peyote was believed to be a god-powerful medicine, with the ability to give sight to the blind and healing incurable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the Spanish Conquistadors in the 16the century forced these age old traditions and cultures into the underground. They quickly outlawed “peyotism”, linking it with witchcraft and cannibalism, and enacted the first “anti-drug” laws in the western hemisphere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part the Conquistadors succeeded, driving the indigenous peyote based religion underground for the next 200 or so years, until the American Civil War. During the American Civil War, peyote began spreading from Mexico on a large scale. Indian prophets such as Quanah Parker and John Wilson, modified the traditional teachings, blending the traditional Peyote chants and rituals with Christian Theology and belief in Jesus. The Christianised versions of the traditional rituals were carried to more than fifty American tribes, including the Chyenne, Shawne, Blackfoot, and Sioux, all the way to north Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1918, a group of peyotists formed the Native American Church to preserve peyote rituals and fight for the continued sacramental use of the plant. Even though laws in 11 states eventually sought to ban the religious use of Peyote, federal courts affirmed the right to sacramental use by the native American members of the 250,000 member church.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley"&gt;Aldous Huxley&lt;/a&gt; played a huge part in transforming public perception about mescaline. Huxley was a well known English literary scholar and controversial writer from the prominent Huxley family, probably best known for his book “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_New_World"&gt;A Brave New World&lt;/a&gt;”. A Brave New World paints a grim picture of a dystopian world ruled by a single corporation, in which people are cloned for their specific roles in society, and drugged from birth so as to never question their role in society. Alphas represent the aristocrats and politicians, Betas are administrators and managers, and Deltas are the workers and labourers. Despite the grim concept and setting, the book paints a picture of hope as the main character awakens to realise the lie he has been taught, and begins his own personal revolution. Since the book was written back in 1931, many people, especially today, say Huxley was a prophet with an uncanny ability to glimpse the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1954, Aldous Huxley began experimenting with mescaline, and as a result he wrote “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_of_Perception"&gt;The Doors of Perception&lt;/a&gt;”. The book is a vivid visual commentary on life, art and culture as perceived through the eyes of mescaline. “The Doors of Perception” was one of the key literary works responsible for the 60’s social revolution and counterculture. It’s safe to say that with it, Huxley changed the world. Without it there would be no luminaries such as Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsburg, no “turn on, tune in, drop out”, no Merry Pranksters, no Sergeant Pepper, and no Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1955, English politician Christopher Mayhew took part in an experiment for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd4rgyZzseY"&gt;BBC’s Panorama&lt;/a&gt;, in which he ingested 400mg of mescaline under the supervision of psychiatrist Humphry Osmond. Though the recording was deemed too controversial and ultimately omitted from the show. Mayhew praised the experience, calling it “the most interesting thing I ever did”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1990 the challengers finally had their day, with the US supreme court affirmed the right of individual states to control ritual use. Today, Mescaline is illegal in most parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As humans it’s our duty to evolve as individuals and as a species, but as time goes by the odd stack up against us as our reliance on technology strengthens, and our connection to nature weakens. The powers that be seek to keep us distracted from the path with their weapons of fear and control, but we have our own weapons that exist freely in nature, and within ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychedelics help us to perceive the reality of our existence and break down the barriers of duality that separate our collective minds. They show us that the “system” we work for is fundamentally flawed, and compromised at the highest level, they show us that the social conditioning and unconscious patterning that binds our minds is laughable, they show us that science and religion doesn’t hold the answers we’re looking for, and most of all they teach us the wisdom and insight to move forward with love in our hearts and a smile on our faces - despite the madness we’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
In order to improve our understanding of the nature of reality and who we are we need to explore all possibilities. 
We need to explore all possibilities in order to gain a greater understanding of the fabric and nature of reality. Therefore, it’s in our best interests we need to put aside our social conditioning, and open our minds to the possibility that science does’t hold the answers, and that the rules enforced upon us by those in power are not necessarily for our own good, they are often to keep us blind to the truth, because let’s face it, what leader that rules by fear and control wants 6 billion liberated free thinkers on their hands? 

, so no wonder they are illegal.

If one has never gazed into the eyes of your lover or soulmate on mescaline, all I can say to you is "don’t knock it till you’ve tried it".

control our minds with 
Each different molecule in nature has it’s own unique signature and properties, so stop proliferating the ignorance of classifying all substances as ‘drugs’ just because they’re illegal.
It is therefore, in our best interests to put aside our social conditioning, and open our minds to the possibility that science does’t have all the answers in order to explore all possibilities.
