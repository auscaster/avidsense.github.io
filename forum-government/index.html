Because of this multi-faceted selfishness, we could very easily render our planet uninhabitable during this century.</p> <p>On this score, the new age movement and fundamentalist Christians share some common ground. The new age movement looks to the ancient Mayan calendar and December 2012 as the end of an age, while millions of Christians believe we are in the end-times, with Armageddon a few short years away.</p> <p>However it is not just these spiritual and religious groups that believe our way of living must come to an end. It is a belief commonly held by a significant proportion, if not a majority of socially aware people around the globe, that our current situation is hopeless and that some sort of cataclysm is necessary if we are to birth a new and better reality.</p> <p>The irony is that world-wide we have millions of highly intelligent people with brilliant ideas that have the potential to create a wonderful new paradigm in every facet of our lives. These same people almost invariably feel disenfranchised and apathetic, while a tiny minority controlled by vested interests drives us further into the mire.</p> <p>If we are to survive, let alone prosper, we must now develop new, more intelligent ways of governing ourselves, so that we learn to harness and benefit from this phenomenal resource. Our only hope now is to learn how to objectively develop policies that are based on the best of our combined thought processes.</p> <h2 id=back-to-basics>Back to Basics</h2> <p>The justification for this is simple. If there were 100 of us left on Earth, huddled up in a cave, pondering our future, would we want to elect and pay someone to do our thinking for us, or would we want to hold a facilitated meeting that would synergise the best of our ideas? Not much of a choice, is it?</p> <p>Forum Government is a new concept and consequently not much thought has gone into it. In practice, it requires an objective evaluation process according to a set of predetermined core values. These values should reflect our highest potential and could include, for example, innovation, empowerment, open co-operation, self-sufficiency and sustainability.</p> <p>Each submitted idea or variation of an idea is rated by a panel of qualified experts, with each government portfolio having it’s own panel. Governments are elected on the basis of the core values they espouse, rather than the promises they make, the difference being that there is no longer a direct connection between politician and outcome. That equates with less scope for corruption.</p> <p>With computers we have the potential to implement Forum Government. Certainly we need to develop the software to make it fair, workable and incorruptible, however once the Bill Gates’ of our world set their minds to it, it will quickly become practicable. </p> <p>Then we must insist on it, in the knowledge that it is ultimately irresistible.</p> <h2 id=the-nature-of-the-beast>The Nature of the Beast</h2> <p>For all our recent technological advancements, we humans are a pretty pathetic bunch. We have promoted ourselves to our level of incompetency and are quite simply unfit to be in control of this planet. This is what so many of us know in our heart of hearts. It’s not that we’re all rotten, it just that the way we govern ourselves belongs in the dark ages and it’s hard to change.</p> <p>Humanity is capable of supreme altruism, heroism and concerted action, especially when all else has failed. There can be little doubt that those qualities will kick in when we reach that stage. Though we are probably there right now, the pain is not yet great enough. Denial prevails.</p> <p>In our current world situation, it is difficult to know what that stage looks like. My guess is we’ll need to endure the suffering of the loss of a significant % of the population. Impoverishment of the wealthy is another criterion and we’re going down that road right now.</p> <p>However, there is an intermediate stage we must pass through before crying enough and stepping into our inherent greatness. That is the stage of the one world government, the pinnacle of globalization and all the other dehumanizing polices that are turning our world into a soup kitchen with insufficient soup. Rest assured, the blueprint of the ultimate prize is waiting in the wings.</p> <h2 id=the-2080-rule>The 20%/80% Rule</h2> <p>Humanity is controlled though fear. Just as a small child instinctively knows how to manipulate it’s parents, so do our political leaders know they can persuade us to follow a course of action by making us afraid of the consequences of it’s alternative.</p> <p>Of course, there are those whose intellect allows them to transcend that to a greater or lesser extent, however they are a distinct minority, say, 20%.</p> <p>So we have a bizarre situation in which the “will” of the “unthinking” 80% can be easily manipulated to swamp the superior thinking of the 20%, implementing policies and agendas that serve only a powerful few, who are beholding to their peers, with little regard for the opinions of the masses.</p> <p>History is replete with examples of nations unjustly waging war on other nations, supported by a majority which has been made afraid of the consequences of not doing so.</p> <p>This is obvious and anyone reading this article will know it to be true. It is the nature of things on planetarium Earth.</p> <p>It is why democracy must now die… </p> <h2 id=our-only-chance>Our Only Chance</h2> <p>A tiny window of opportunity exists for us to turn our future around. We have the opportunity, right now, to investigate and develop the mechanisms that will enable to shrug off our sense of fear, apathy and doom; the very mechanisms that we will need when we reach the critical stage outlined above.</p> <p>Forum government can’t and won’t happen now. The death throes of the old, tried and false have just begun.</p> <p>But there is a lot of work to be done developing computer models for objective policy making, based on diverse inputs.</p> <p>For there will surely soon come a time when the metaphorical 100 will need them.</p> </body></html> </div> </div> <div class="large-4 columns"> <div class=sidebar> <div class="sidebar-section toc"> <h4 class=no_toc id=contents>Contents</h4> <ul id=markdown-toc> <li><a href="#back-to-basics">Back to Basics</a></li> <li><a href="#the-nature-of-the-beast">The Nature of the Beast</a></li> <li><a href="#the-2080-rule">The 20%/80% Rule</a></li> <li><a href="#our-only-chance">Our Only Chance</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="sidebar-section tags"> <h4>Tags</h4> <ul><li><a href="/tags/government/">Government</a></li><li><a href="/tags/policy/">Policy</a></li></ul> </div> <div class="sidebar-section ad ad-300x250 sidebar-float"> <ins class=adsbygoogle style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:600px" data-ad-client=ca-pub-1397369873900370 data-ad-slot=2197667680></ins> <script>
