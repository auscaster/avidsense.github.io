Such questions they may never be answered, and the answers probably wouldn’t change anything anyway. What really matters is the state of our current existentiality, because for damn sure we can do something about that.</p> <h2 id=disambiguation-and-explanation>Disambiguation and Explanation</h2> <p>The word “purpose” is used to describe the reason for which something exists, so when used in relation to one’s life, it means quite simply the “reason for one’s existence”. Therefore, “living for purpose” is the act of living for a something greater than ourselves. It could be said that soldier in the army “serves a purpose”, and that would be technically correct, but that concept of purpose is inherently different the concept of “living for purpose” posed by this article, which is unique to the sovereign individual.</p> <p>Those who practice “living for purpose”, live by a profound existential philosophy than runs much deeper than the functional conotation of “purpose”. Purpose becomes one’s very reason for drawing breath - the driving force behind one’s every thought and action. This is because the person of purpose understands that highest aim for a human life is to live for purpose, and that we are all accountable for the way we live our lives. Many people would look upon this kind of attitude and judge it as “obsessive” and “fanatical”, but on the whole these people don’t and can’t understand what it is to live for something greater than a preconception. </p> <p>People who perceive the world through the matrix of their individual preconceptions are affected by them in every thought and deed. Since purpose is not defined at the scope of the individual, it is impossible for affected individuals to comprehend what it means to live a life of purpose. Thus, a life of true purpose is only obtainable by the <a href="/matrix-of-misconception">free and awakened individual</a>.</p> <p>Furthermore, true purpose if not bound by a specific outcome. This is a very challenging concept for people to grasp, because we’ve been conditioned to expect payment for our efforts, either by way of financial or energetic exchange. If you’re asking “what’s in it for me?”, then you’re not living for purpose, you’re living for your own concerns. As soon as it becomes about what you’re going to “get”, then true purpose becomes tainted. There’s nothing wrong with that, it’s what makes the world go round in it’s current dysfunctional state, but don’t be mistaken, it’s not true purpose. With purpose as a guide, one acts simply because one can, and because it’s the right thing to do.</p> <h2 id=false-idols>False Idols</h2> <p>There’s no end of so-called prophets and gurus out there masquerading as peddlers of truth. These types of gurus speak with great conviction and charisma, and prey on the weak minded and impressionable lost souls who’re seeking answers. Of course, the only outcome is further distraction and confusion from truth. Any man who would elevate himself above others, glorify himself, enforce worship, or inspire followers through fear, insecurity or rage, should never be trusted.</p> <p>Dedication to a passion or goal should not be confused with purpose. When it comes to truth, even 1% off is dangerous, and may be difficult or impossible to distinguish for the uninitiated. Some of the worst attrocities have been comitted by dedicated and charismatic men who saw themselves as godlike, and were deluded enough to think what they were doing the “right thing”.</p> <p>The world is full of cases of the blind leading the blind, and it must be exposed, not proliferated.</p> <h2 id=the-power-of-purpose>The Power of Purpose</h2> <p>For an individual to hold a position of purpose is a very powerful thing, but when purpose is shared between a man and a woman the effects are multiplied many times. The combination of masculine drive and female creation united under a common purpose is a sacred bond with the power to achieve the impossible.</p> <p>The nature of purpose is that in essence it’s impeccable and incorruptible, and therefore inspires similar traits in those is affects. This kind of intent speaks to people on a primal level, and is powerful enough to topple governments if assimilated on a large scale. This kind of revolution is far superior to a violent uprising, which only serves to precipitate the cycle of oppression.</p> <p>Mankind is almost ready for a new precedent, and the global information network is ready to spread it to the four corners of the earth when it takes place.</p> </body></html> </div> </div> <div class="large-4 columns"> <div class=sidebar> <div class="sidebar-section toc"> <h4 class=no_toc id=contents>Contents</h4> <ul id=markdown-toc> <li><a href="#disambiguation-and-explanation">Disambiguation and Explanation</a></li> <li><a href="#false-idols">False Idols</a></li> <li><a href="#the-power-of-purpose">The Power of Purpose</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="sidebar-section tags"> <h4>Tags</h4> <ul><li><a href="/tags/philosophy/">Philosophy</a></li><li><a href="/tags/psychology/">Psychology</a></li></ul> </div> <div class="sidebar-section ad ad-300x250 sidebar-float"> <ins class=adsbygoogle style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:600px" data-ad-client=ca-pub-1397369873900370 data-ad-slot=2197667680></ins> <script>
